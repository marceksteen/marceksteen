    <techniques>Probability simulation. Python: matplotlib, numpy.</techniques>
    <description>Created a simulation of the Monty Hall problem for an article I wrote on Medium. Most of the work honestly went into making
    the graph look nice. I wanted it to match the colour scheme of the other diagrams in the article. </description>

    <techniques>Python: pytorch, manim. Convolutional neural networks. </techniques>
    <description>I wanted to create a nice animated diagram of a CNN (convolutional neural network) for an article I wrote on Medium.
    The article was generally about artificial intelligence, and I thought it would be helpful to have a nice illustrative gif of a classic
    AI problem - recognising digits. I created this animation using Pytorch and Manim.</description>
